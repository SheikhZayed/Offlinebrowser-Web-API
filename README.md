yet another boilerpipe API implementation on GAE

This Web App is based on Boiler Pipe Java Library,It Extracts the Texttual Content of the Webpage,it works as similar to the
main web api(boilerpipe-web.appspot.com),i have developed this application,due to the main reason that i use it a lot(yes!really 
lot on my projects)the server used to give me an over quota error which drastically effected my apps..

this project can be used freely with no quota limits..

try the demo at http://offlinebrowser-web.appspot.com/
